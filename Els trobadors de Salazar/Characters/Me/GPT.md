Backstory (Tyrion Lannister-Inspired)
Tyrion was born into a family that sees him as a “monster” because of his size and differences. A member of the Lannister family, he was constantly underestimated and ignored, but he proved that wits and charm could outdo brute strength. He left his family’s shadow, making his own way in the world as a Deep Gnome Wizard, mastering arcane knowledge and magical combat. With his War Magic and cunning nature, he blends both intellect and combat to outsmart his foes and survive in the world that’s always conspired against him. As a Rock Gnome, he’s used to tinkering and applying his intellect in creative ways, especially when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds.

Summary
This Tyrion Lannister-inspired Rock Gnome Wizard is a highly strategic and tactical character with high Intelligence and access to powerful spells. Combining the War Magic subclass with the War Caster feat allows you to effectively balance between magic and combat, using cantrips and spells to control the flow of battle. Your Deep Gnome racial traits provide the perfect foundation for stealth and resilience, and your Tinker’s tools reflect Tyrion’s knack for clever invention. All of this makes for a highly powerful, fun, and nuanced character, perfect for min-maxing and roleplaying!
